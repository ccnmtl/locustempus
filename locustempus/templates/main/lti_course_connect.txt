Dear colleague,

You have successfully created a new Locus Tempus site for {{course.title}}.

The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) offers instructors a range of support for using Locus Tempus effectively.

CTL learning designers can help you conceptualize and set up projects in Locus Tempus. We are also happy to offer in-person training sessions for your class. Please email us at ccnmtl-locustempus@columbia.edu to request a consultation or training.

Locus Tempus is designed and maintained here at the CTL, and we are always eager to receive ideas from the Columbia community â€“ please let us know how it goes! We hope you have a successful semester using Locus Tempus.


Thanks,
The Locus Tempus Staff
